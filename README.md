# FireFly Tokens Microservice for ERC20 & ERC721

This project provides a thin shim between [FireFly](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly)
and ERC20/ERC721 contracts exposed via [ethconnect](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-ethconnect).

Based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Nest](http://nestjs.com).

This service is entirely stateless - it maps incoming REST operations directly to ethconnect
calls, and maps ethconnect events to outgoing websocket events.

This repository also includes sample [Solidity contracts](samples/solidity/) that conform to the ABIs
expected by this connector. These contracts may be used to get up and running with simple token
support, and may provide a starting point for developing production contracts that can be used
with this connector.

## POST APIs

The following POST APIs are exposed under `/api/v1`:

* `POST /createpool` - Create a new instance of an ERC20 contract (inputs: name, symbol, data, config)
* `POST /activatepool` - Activate a token contract to begin receiving transfers (inputs: poolLocator, poolData)
* `POST /mint` - Mint new tokens (inputs: poolLocator, to, amount, data)
* `POST /burn` - Burn tokens (inputs: poolLocator, tokenIndex, from, amount, data)
* `POST /transfer` - Transfer tokens (inputs: poolLocator, tokenIndex, from, to, amount, data)
* `POST /approval` - Approve/unapprove another party to manage tokens (inputs: poolLocator, operator, approved, data, config)

All requests may be optionally accompanied by a `requestId`, which must be unique for every
request and will be returned in the "receipt" websocket event.

All APIs are async and return 202 immediately with a response of the form `{id: string}`.
If no `requestId` was provided, this will be a randomly assigned ID. Clients should
subscribe to the websocket (see below) in order to receive feedback when the async
operation completes.

## Extra config

Some APIs accept a `config` object which includes options specific to the underlying contract, outside
of the general `fftokens` API specification.

**POST /createpool**

```
config: {
  address?: string, // Address of a pre-deployed contract to index
  blockNumber?: string, // Starting block to begin indexing (only valid with "address")
}
```

**POST /approval**

```
config: {
  allowance?: string, // Number of tokens operator is allowed to manage (only valid with ERC20)
  tokenIndex?: string, // A specific NFT operator is allowed to manage (only valid with ERC721)
}
```

## Websocket events

Websocket notifications can be received by connecting to `/api/ws`.
All events have the form `{event: string, id: string, data: any}`.

When any POST operation completes, it will trigger a websocket event of the form:
`{event: "receipt", data: {id: string, success: bool, message?: string}}`.
This event is sent to all connected websocket clients and is informative only (does
not require any acknowledgment).

Successful POST operations will also result in a detailed event corresponding to the type of
transaction that was performed. The events and corresponding data items are:

* `token-pool` - Token pool created (outputs: poolLocator, signer, data)
* `token-mint` - Tokens minted (outputs: id, poolLocator, tokenIndex, signer, to, amount, data)
* `token-burn` - Tokens burned (outputs: id, poolLocator, tokenIndex, signer, from, amount, data)
* `token-transfer` - Tokens transferred (outputs: id, poolLocator, signer, from, to, amount, data)
* `token-approval` - Tokens approved (outputs: id, subject, poolLocator, signer, operator, approved, data)

If multiple websocket clients are connected, only one will receive these events.
Each one of these _must_ be acknowledged by replying on the websocket with `{event: "ack", data: {id}}`.

## GET APIs

The following GET APIs are exposed under `/api/v1`:

* `GET /receipt/:id` - Get receipt for a previous request

## Running the service

The easiest way to run this service is as part of a stack created via
[firefly-cli](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli).

To run manually, you first need to run an Ethereum blockchain node and an instance of
[firefly-ethconnect](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-ethconnect), and deploy the
[ERC20 smart contract](solidity/contracts/ERC20MixedFungible.sol).

Then, adjust your configuration to point at the deployed contract by editing [.env](.env)
or by setting the environment values directly in your shell.

Install and run the application using npm:

```bash
# install
$ npm install

# run in development mode
$ npm run start

# run in watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# run in production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

View the generated OpenAPI spec at http://localhost:3000/api-json

## Manually deploy contracts

To deploy both ERC20 and ERC721 contracts to a FireFly network, use the provided `deploy` script powered by [hardhat](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat).

```bash
cd samples/solidity
npm install
npm run deploy
```

Note: [firefly-cli](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli) will take care of contract deployment during stack creation.

## Testing

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# lint
$ npm run lint

# formatting
$ npm run format
```
